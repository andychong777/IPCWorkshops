1. Three reasons we try to use variables and macros to represent information 
rather than hardcode magic numbers because if we were to update the macros
MIN_YEAR and MAX_YEAR to for example MAX_YEAR 2023, or MIN_YEAR 1999, it would
apply across the entire code.
Next advantage is that it defining macros or variables makes your code clear to
follow and understand. In the workshop when calculating Average Evening Rating we
divided eveningSum by LOG_DAYS making it much easier to understand. If we were to
a magic number it would not have any explanation of what it is or where that 
number is coming from.
Last advantage is that because we declared macros MIN_YEAR AND MAX_YEAR we can 
keep using it in our code at any point and will keep same value.

2. When calculating the sums and averages in our workshop we don't have to put 
it in an iteration because it does not require to run multiple times. We just
take the output from the loop and use it to make calculations.
We do not include additional logic that sums and performs the average inside an
iteration because can make the code inaccurate or inefficient. Also calculating 
outside the iteration makes the code more readable as well as preventing reiteration.
