1. One benefit of returning values in two different ways is because it provides more 
flexibility and usability. If you only need one result value, you can use the return 
value and ignore the pointer parameter. Another benefit is that if you need to get 
multiple result values, you can use the pass-by-reference parameter to get all of 
it at once. Making it more versatile and easier to use. The downside is that it 
can make the code more complex. It can make it unclear to others leading to potential 
bugs and confusion. Lastly it makes it harder to maintain and make changes to my 
code because there are multiple ways of returning values from 1 function, causing 
one to make changes in multiple places.

2.The function convertLbs converts lbs into both kilograms and grams which we already
did in functions convertLbsKg and convertLbsG. This module is performing multiple
tasks instead of one specific task. Thus, making it have low cohesion. I would 
instead directly call them from the previous functions that already made the calculations
instead of doing a new function. 
A function that has high coupling is the calculateReportData function. I would combine
it with the function getCatFoodInfo because we are setting (=) the data to a previously
done data instead of just using what we already had to calculate report data.

3. Advantages of passing structures is that it can improve performance by taking 
up less memory usage. Instead of passing each member of a struct as separate arguments,
you can pass it by reference, rather than passing by value. You can make it more efficient 
by using pointers instead. Using pointers are a more efficient way to pass data to 
functions because you don't have to copy large amounts of data. You can also use 
const references to pass a struct to the function making the function have access 
without coping the whole struct. We can improve "displayCatfoodData" by passing 
the struct through pass by value or reference instead of doing each structure member 
1 at a time.
