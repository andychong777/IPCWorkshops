	I took Harvards online course cs50- Intro to Computer Science in order to explore and see if this is something I really wanted to do as a career. While taking the course although I have yet to complete it, I had learned the basics on how to code in C, as well as the syntax. The compiling process of turning a C text file into an executable program consists of changing our programming language into machine language. My goals for this course is to be consistent and keep up to date week to week in order to achieve the goal of being capable to understand and code on my own.
