1. Here is the copy of the submitted code for the part of the logic number of servings to the available coffee bag weights.
((servings >=1 && servings <=4) && (weight1 == 250)) ||
((servings >4 && servings <= 9) && (weight1 ==  500)) ||
((servings >9) && (weight1 ==  1000)),

a) I used a total of 4 relational expressions in my code. First is >= which means left is greater than or equal to the right. Secondly i used <= which means left is less than or equal to the right. Next i used == which means that left is equal to the right. Lastly I used > which means left is greater than the right

b)I used a total of 2 logical expressions in my code. First is && which means both operands are true. The second logical expression is || which means this or that, in other words one of the operands are true.

2. This is the way I coded part 1 output 9 (id3 != id1) && (id3 != id2). The method I used in my code did not use DeMorgan's Law. If you were to use the DeMorgan's Law method it would look like this:  !((id3 == id1) || (id3 == id1)).

3. Here are two ways you can organize variables. First way you can organize variables is by the identifiers within a single declaration.
For example:
char bestServed1, bestServed2, bestServed3, coffeeType1, coffeeType2, coffeeType3, coffeeStrength, cream;
int servings, weight1, weight2, weight3;
const double GRAMS_IN_LBS = 453.5924;

The other method you can organize variables is by grouping related variables together. This method makes it easier to read and see the different variables and where they are used.
For example:
const double GRAMS_IN_LBS = 453.5924;
char coffeeType1, coffeeType2, coffeeType3;
char bestServed1, bestServed2, bestServed3;
char coffeeStrength, cream;
int weight1, weight2, weight3;
int servings;

Both ways however it is important to declare all variables at the top, using camel notation, avoiding too many variables as well as making variables easy to recognize.
